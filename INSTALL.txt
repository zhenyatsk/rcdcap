1. Fedora
---------

First of all, you must install the dependencies and some development tools.
Start a terminal and login as root, then execute the following commands:

yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
yum install boost-devel libpcap-devel libstdc++-static cmake

Return back to an unprivileged user and get into the project top directory(the directory
outside the extracted source folder) and type:

mkdir build-make
cd build-make
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" ../*source
make
cpack -D CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG=1 -D CPACK_RPM_SPEC_INSTALL_POST="/bin/true" \
      -G RPM

      

Finally, you must install the package that you have just created as root:

rpm -ihv RCDCap-*.rpm
