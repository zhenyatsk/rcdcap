RCDCap-0.9.1
===========
Add support Transparent Ethernet bridging (0x6558)

RCDCap-0.9.0
============
Type I and II ERSPAN

RCDCap-0.8.0
============
Better queuing

RCDCap-0.7.99
=============
Advanced packet analysis features preview:
* Configurable burst packet processing.
* Injecting traffic to regular Ethernet device.
* Discard Sink for enabling pure traffic analysis.
* Daemomization.
* Statistics Sink for analysing pipeline performance.
* DHCP, DHCPv6, NDP and ARP traffic monitoring by using the extension
  Quiet Neighborhood.
* Plug-ins are built by default.
  * It can be used to capture rogue DHCP servers and hosts that are
    sending wrong Router Advertisement messages.
  * IEEE 802.1Q VLAN support is included.
  * Automatic learning phase is supported.
  * The data is kept in optimized structure for multithreaded processing.
  * The network table is saved in user readable format (XML, JSON or INFO).
  * It includes a list of all legitimate and suspicious hosts, VLANs and
    subnets.


RCDCap-0.7.1
============
GCC-4.7.x build fixes.


RCDCap-0.7.0
============
Plug-in system related improvements and bug fixes, but the main feature in
this release is:
* Python binding plug-in.


RCDCap-0.6.0
============
Again, a release that includes just new features:
* RCDCap now includes a simple plug-in system that enables extending it with
  new data sources, processors and data sinks.
* A simple VLAN monitor is included as an example. It could be used to detect
  untagged Ethernet frames and unexpected VLAN identifiers inside the monitored
  network.
* It is now possible to disable the buffer memory locking; therefore, enabling
  a regular user to run the UDP socket-based data source used for capturing
  HP ERM.
* The UDP socket-based data source now defaults to port 7932.


RCDCap-0.5.0
============
It includes mostly new features:
* Now it is possible to run the processor without applying the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN
  tag by using the --disable-vlan-tag command line options.
* A new UDP socket-based data source is provided for HP ERM.

RCDCap-0.4.0
============
New features and performance improvements:
* When RCDCap is started on more than one thread, it starts the capture process
  in its own separate thread by default.
* Thread pinning is now available as a command line option.
* The algorithm for the capturing process could be chosen with a command line
  option.

RCDCap-0.3.1
============
Minor improvements:
* Documentation improvements.
* RCDCap no longer prints extra data to the standard output when binary format
  is chosen.
* Additional packet counters.

RCDCap-0.3.0
============
Major refactoring and new command line options:
* The snapshot length could be now specified by applying the --snaplen
  command line option.
* RCDCap now uses a fixed internal buffer to store all of the packets that
  are going to be processed.
* The size of the internal buffer could be specified with the --buffer-size
  command line option.
* An optional PF_RING support is included, which is enabled by applying the
  --pfring command line option when capturing data from a device.
* Improved statistics.

RCDCap-0.2.0
============
This version just includes minor fixes and improvements:
* Some documentation improvements.
* The command line option --tap-device now has an optional argument, which
  is the name of the TAP device that must be created.
* The --tap-dev-name command line option was removed.
* You can make the TAP device persistent by adding the --tap-persist option.
* There is a new option --tap-dev-addr, which is used for specifying the IPv4
  address of the TAP device.

RCDCap-0.1.1
============
The initial version of the package. It contains the following features:
* HP ERM decapsulation.
* ERSPAN decapsulation.
* VLAN support (802.1Q and 802.1P).
* Outputting the processed data to a libpcap dump file, the standard output,
  or a TAP device.
